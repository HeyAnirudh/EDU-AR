# EDU-AR

Our solution is totally smartphone application based , application is supported on both the platforms Android and iOS . user  needs to download our AR application from the respective application stores of android and iOS . once the user installs the AR application in their smartphone device they need to launch the application , post launching the user needs to enter the details for registration purpose or the user can login with their login credentials . after logging in to the application the user can select their respective discipline of their interest which they want to explore , later they will be redirected to select their course related concepts which they want to view in a real time 3D-Fied way , after selecting the concept the click will trigger the device camera and the user needs to scan the associated target image once the device recognizes the target image then the 3D model of the academic concept with visual animations will be projected over the target image in the real time adjusting automatically with user dimensions with features like virtual buttons , this all is done with the concept of Augmented reality technology.
